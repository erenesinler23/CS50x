Question 1: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Answer: The average energy of the top 100 songs is 0.66 and there is only one song which is 1, 2, 3 by Jason Derulo
that both danceability, energy and valence greater than 0.75. This means that the user is more likely that has a a music aura
which is calm.


Question 2: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Answer: I calculated this aura by taking the average energy of the users' top 100 songs. This method could be improved by expanding the search and analyzing
the users' preferences of music in certain times and dates.
