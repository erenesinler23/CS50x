Questions:
Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Answer: When the number of simulations increased, the percentage of a country winning the
world cup is stabilized and the answers were quite the same.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Answer: I think that 10000 is enough, in 10000, the answers were nearly the same.
Also, 1 million is too much and there is no need to simulate this much.
